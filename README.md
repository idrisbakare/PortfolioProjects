# (Trends in Prosper Loan Dataset)
## by (Idris)



## Dataset

The Prosper loan dataset contains information on 113,937 loans taken by Americans in various parts of the country spread across 81 fields. Some of the fields include loan amount, borrower rate, current loan status, borrower state etc. I carried out some data wrangling and exploratory data analysis on the dataset to spot trends and patterns in borrower behaviour for patrons of the Prosper Loan.

## Summary of Findings

In the course of my exploration, I uncovered some key insights from the data. The borrower rate from each loan application tends to peak between 10 and 20 percent with rates around 14% being the most frequently occurring. Some outliers were observed around 33% rates but generally begin to decline after 20%.

The most collected loan amounts were observed to be around 10 and 15 thousand dollars with a gradual decline is amounts after 15k. In terms of loan collection rates over the years, the year 2009 was recorded to be the year with the lowest collection rate, while the most loans were take in 2013. A positively increasing trend can be observed in the number of loan collected between 2009 and 2013 and dropping afterwards in 2014. 

Going further, I discovered a clear negative correlation (as expected) in the borrower rates and Prosper rating. customers who have high ratings perhaps having proved their credibility and trustworthiness over the years were give much lower rates in comparison to customers with low prosper ratings.A slight negative correlation was also observed between loan amounts and borrower rates with higher amounts getting lower rates and vice-versa.

It was also observed that the overwelming majority of loans were provided to borrowers with the Debt-to-Income Ratio of below 0.6. Overcredited borrowers with DIR above 0.4 are very rare in the dataset. Also, the higher the Debt-to-Income Ratio is, the lower the Loan Amount is.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> The vast majority of borrower rates were observed between 10 and 20 percent. The major factors affecting the interest rates are the loan amount and prosper ratings. Higher loan amounts are generally charged less interests and customer with low Prosper ratings getting high interest rates.
